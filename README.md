# Golja


## Notes
- represent Board as a list of arrays?
- Board would know it's own dimensions
- mehtods in BoardManager could most likely be implemented in Board class


## Development

After cloning the repo, run:
```shell
gradle wrapper --gradle-version=$v --distribution-type=$distType
```
This will auto generate the proper version of the gradle wrapper from
`/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`.
